# Roadmap

## Short Term

### Improve Usability

- Typical workflows should be supported by using much less complex forms.
- Only the well-supported mime-types should be used. Strange media formats should be abandoned.


### Move to KS Deck of Cards and KS Modals

Any new development in the presentation of the media casts should include the move to the current KS elements and introduce a Lightbox Video Page.


## Mid Term

### Improve Architecture

- Introduce repository pattern
- Improve DI handling
- Factor business logic out of UI classes


## Long Term
