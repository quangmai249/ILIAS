## General Documentation

### Export

Business Rules
* **Referenced terms** are exported as they were terms of the exported glossary. This means on import the glossary will contain copies of the referenced terms.
* **References to auto-linked** glossaries will be established on import, if the referenced glossary has been imported before.
